## Overview of the statistical analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to obtain statistical parameters for the viability of a new business in Oahu - Hawai. The shop will provide ice-cream products and surfing supplies, that is why it is important to anlyse the weather precipitation and temperature in the area. The sample data for this report will be based on two months: June and December.

## Results

- June

- December

Results based on June and December statistical analysis:

- The small difference between the number of samples (count) to calculate the statistical results for both months shows that the comparison will provide an accurate analysis and estimation.

- The average shows a higher result for June than for December. It seems as if there is a high chance to increase the ice-cream selling margin during June because of the good conditions. 

- The maximum temperatures are very similar for both months. Despite of the lower average in December, Hawaii will have some days with a high temperature very close to the maximum in June.

- Comparing both minimum values, we can observe the lowest value in December. The difference is big enough to be considered as a parameter for the shop opening days.
