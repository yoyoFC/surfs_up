Results based on June and December statistical analysis:

- The small difference between the number of samples (count) to calculate the statistical results for both months shows that the comparison will provide an accurate analysis and estimation.

- The average shows a higher result for June than for December. There is a high chance to increase the ice-cream selling margin during June because of the good conditions. 

- The maximum temperatures are very similar for both months. Despite of the lower average in December, Hawaii will have some days with a high temperature very close to the maximum in June.

- Comparing both minimum values, we can observe the lowest value in December. The difference is big enough to be considered as a parameter for the shop opening days.
